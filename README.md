👋 Hey there!

I'm Curtis Milne, your friendly neighbourhood tech enthusiast and the host of **The Azure Corner**! 🌐

Welcome to my **GitHub corner**, where I'm diving into demos, tinkering with code, and contributing to the awesome tech community whenever I can. Like every curious techie out there, I'm constantly learning new tricks—so if you spot something cool or quirky, share the love and send it my way! 💡

Let’s geek out together—catch me on LinkedIn or over on YouTube at **@TheAzureCorner**.

Let's make tech fun AND understandable for everyone! 🚀
